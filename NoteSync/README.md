NoteSync App
NoteSync - Keep your notes secure is a user-friendly web application designed for convenient note-taking. It incorporates a secure user authentication system, allowing users to easily manage their notes, ensuring that their thoughts and ideas are captured, edited, and accessible anytime, anywhere. Users have the flexibility to edit existing notes and delete ones they no longer require. This platform offers a seamless experience for efficient note-taking and organization.


NoteSync is constructed utilizing a diverse range of technologies, incorporating both frontend and backend components.

On the frontend, we leverage React to craft a dynamic and user-friendly interface. React Router is employed for seamless navigation, ensuring an intuitive user experience. Additionally, Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript contribute to the application's responsiveness and visually appealing styling.

Moving to the backend, we utilize Node.js in conjunction with Express to facilitate API development. This combination allows for robust and efficient server-side processes. For data storage, MongoDB is employed, providing a reliable and scalable database solution.

Ensuring secure authentication, NoteSync implements JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This authentication mechanism adds an extra layer of protection, enhancing the overall security of the application
